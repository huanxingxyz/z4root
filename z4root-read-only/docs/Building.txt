Obtain the Software Needed to Build Android Term
------------------------------------------------

Android is built using the Android SDK 1.6 or newer and the Android NDK r4 or newer.
You can downlaod them from:

http://developer.android.com/sdk

You will also need Eclipse 3.4 or newer, Java version, available from:

http://eclipse.org

After you install the SDK and the NDK, please build some of the samples that
come with the NDK in order to get a feel for using the SDK and the NDK.

Building Android Term
---------------------

There are three parts to building Android Term:

    1) Build the shared library
    2) Create the Eclipse Project for the Application
    3) Build the Java apk.

Build the shared library:

    cd <the-app-where-androidterm-is>
    <path-to-the-android-ndk>/ndk-build
    
  (Be sure to use the actual pathnames from your system. For example,
   on my system I actually type the following:

    cd ~/code/androidterm
    ../android-ndk-r4/ndk-build

This should chug away for a while and ultimately produce the file

libs/armeabi/libterm.so
    
Create the Eclipse project:

    Start Eclipse
    From the menu choose File : New Project
    Choose Android:Android Project as a project type
    Press Next
    Set Project Name: AndroidTerm
    Choose "Create project from existing source"
    Browse to the location of the AndroidTerm source directory.
    Make sure the "Android 1.6" Target Name is checked.
    Make sure the Min SDK Version is 4
    Press Finish
    
    NOTE: When you Press Finish you may get the following error
    
        Invalid project description.
        <path-to-your-project> overlaps the location of another
        project: '<project>'
        
    This seems to be due to a bug in the Android SDK, where it
    can't import projects that are located in the Eclipse "workspace"
    directory. The work-around is to move the androidterm project
    directory to a different location on your file system, so
    that it is _not_ in the Eclipse "workspace" directory.

Build the Java apk:

    This should happen automatically once you've created the Eclipse project.
